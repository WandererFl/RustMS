# RustMS
RustMS is an attempt at implementing the Maplestory server end from scratch in Rust.

At the time at which I am writing this, I know very little about Rust, and I know very little about the actual implementation of the Maplestory server end. I am however quite interested in Rust as I've always had a superficial interest in lower level languages such as C but never really invested enough time to actually get comfortable using them. I've also had recent thoughts about trying to implement a Maplestory server backend due to the fond memories I have with this game from my childhood, and because I am aware that there are several open source implementations floating around Github. My main inspiration at the time being is [Hucaru's project Valhalla](https://github.com/Hucaru/Valhalla), which at the time being is a WIP implementation of a v28 server end in Go.

# Roadmap
To be decided on in the future; for now this will just be some adhoc experimenting until I get a grip on what I'm doing here...
